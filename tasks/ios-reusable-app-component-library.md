## Goal

Establish a reusable iOS app component library.

## Scope

- Define reusable UI component primitives/patterns for iOS.
- Refactor repeated UI patterns into shared components.
- Document component usage and conventions.

## Out Of Scope

- Full visual redesign unrelated to component reuse.
- Android/web component library implementation (tracked separately).

## Acceptance Criteria

- A reusable component library exists and is consumed by app screens.
- Duplicate UI implementations are reduced in key feature flows.
- Documentation/examples exist for component usage.
- iOS tests/build pass after refactor.

## Execution Notes

- Source label: `IOS`
- Source task line: `Reusable App component library (5)`
- Complexity from source: `5`
- Risks: large refactor surface; likely iterative rollout required.
