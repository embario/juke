## Goal

Reach feature parity across all Juke clients.

## Scope

- Identify feature gaps between current clients.
- Define and implement the missing feature set per client.
- Validate parity with a shared checklist.

## Out Of Scope

- New net-new features not already present in at least one client.
- Major visual redesign work unrelated to parity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A parity checklist exists and is complete for web, Android, and iOS clients.
- All agreed parity gaps are implemented or explicitly deferred with rationale.
- Regression tests cover the added/changed parity paths.

## Execution Notes

- Source label: `CLIENTS`
- Source task line: `Reach feature-parity with all Juke app clients`
- Key files: to be determined by parity audit output.
- Commands: use platform-specific scripts and test suites per subproject guides.
- Risks: ambiguous parity definition unless checklist is agreed early.
